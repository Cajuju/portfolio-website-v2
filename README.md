# Brian Robert Cajulis's Portfolio Website
Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website.  I developed this website using React, Bootstrap, and a few NPM packages.  If you have any comments on what I can improve, feel free to leave it in the issues section of this repository.

## Wireframing

[# Screenshots](#screenshots) - Wireframe Overview
[# Conclusion](#conclusion) - Final Thoughts

Before proceeding to develop a project, I always like to get the basic layout of what it will look like.  The platform I used to create these wireframes is [Lucidchard](https://www.lucidchart.com/).

### Conclusion
Developing the second version of my portfolio website has given me a lot of insight about how much I've improved over the years.  It also reminded me of a lesson I learned while studying at Azusa Pacific University.  Plans change over the course of development.  I may have chosen to do one thing, but then decide something else was better.  The most important skill to exercise is to adapt and learn.  I will continue to update this website until I decide to create new version.  The feedback I've received from friends and colleagues helped me make many improvements.
